# Migration Summary: JSON Files ‚Üí Vercel Blob Storage

## ‚úÖ Migration Completed Successfully!

Your campaign site has been fully migrated from local JSON file storage to Vercel Blob Storage.

---

## üì¶ What Was Installed

### New Dependencies Added:

- `@vercel/blob` (v2.0.0) - Vercel Blob Storage SDK
- `dotenv` (v17.2.3) - Environment variable management

```bash
npm install  # Run this if you clone the project fresh
```

---

## üîÑ What Changed

### 1. `server.js` - Complete Rewrite of Storage Logic

**Before:**

```javascript
function appendJSONL(filename, obj) {
  const line = JSON.stringify(obj) + "\n";
  fs.appendFile(path.join(__dirname, "data", filename), line, (err) => {
    if (err) console.error("Failed to write log:", err);
  });
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
async function storeEvent(page, obj) {
  const timestamp = new Date()
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/:/g, "-")
    .replace(/\./g, "-");
  const sessionId = obj.session_id || "unknown";
  const blobName = `logs/${page}/${timestamp}-${sessionId}.json`;

  const blob = await put(blobName, JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2), {
    access: "public",
    token: process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN,
    contentType: "application/json",
  });
}
```

**New Endpoint Added:**

```javascript
GET /api/logs?page=page1&limit=100
```

Returns all stored events in JSON format with filtering options.

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Event Flow:

1. **User visits page** ‚Üí Frontend sends event to `/api/log`
2. **Server receives event** ‚Üí Adds IP, country, city (geolocation)
3. **Store in Vercel Blob** ‚Üí Each event saved as individual JSON file:
   ```
   logs/page1/2025-10-07T10-30-45-123Z-abc123.json
   logs/page2/2025-10-07T10-31-20-456Z-abc123.json
   ```
4. **Retrieve anytime** ‚Üí Via `/api/logs` endpoint or view-logs.html

### Storage Structure:

```
Vercel Blob Store
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page1/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-10-07T10-08-51-820Z-d3c521f5.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-10-07T10-08-53-505Z-d3c521f5.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page2/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-10-07T10-08-53-599Z-d3c521f5.json
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Old JSON Files

- The existing files `/data/page1.jsonl` and `/data/page2.jsonl` are **not deleted**
- They are **no longer used** by the application
- You can keep them for reference or delete them
- They won't be deployed to Vercel (excluded by Vercel's build process)

### Environment Variables

- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is **required** for the app to work
- Without it, events will fail to save (but won't crash the app)
- Set it in:
  - Local: `.env` file
  - Vercel: Project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

### Cost

- Vercel Blob free tier: 100GB storage, 100GB bandwidth/month
- Should be more than enough for a marketing campaign
- Each event is ~1KB, so you can store ~100,000 events in free tier

---

## üß™ Testing the Migration

### Test Locally:

1. **Set environment variable:**
   Create `.env` file:

   ```
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Start server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test the flow:**

   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Click the CTA button
   - Go to page 2 and select an option
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/view-logs.html
   - You should see 5+ events logged! ‚úÖ

4. **Verify Blob Storage:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores
   - Click your Blob store
   - Browse `logs/` folder
   - You should see your event files!
